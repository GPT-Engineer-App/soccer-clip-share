== Background

The Soccer Game Video Clips Sharing Web App is designed to cater to soccer enthusiasts who want to share and view memorable moments from soccer games. Users can register and authenticate using popular OAuth providers, ensuring a secure and straightforward login process. Once authenticated, users can upload video clips corresponding to specific moments in a soccer game, which are then displayed on a timeline-based interface for easy navigation.

The backend of the application is developed using the FastAPI framework in Python, providing a robust and scalable REST API for the frontend. This choice ensures rapid development and high performance, catering to the needs of a growing user base.

Users will also be able to playback the video clips. If there are multiple clips corresponding to the same moment, they can be played simultaneously to provide a comprehensive view of that moment from different perspectives.
